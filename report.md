### Part 2: Set up a central github repo and try out:	

We set up a github repository by clicking 'new repository' on the github website.
Our next step is to read the recommended instructions on the website. To create a new repository on the command line , it tells us to:

1. echo "# test" >> README.md
2. git init
3. git add README.md
4. git commit -m "first commit"
5. git branch -M main
6. git remote add origin https://github.com/abductedRhino/test.git
7. git push -u origin main


* sharing files and changes
* different workflows (see git slides)
* resolving merge conflicts
* rebasing, merging, fast-forwarding
